# Parallel Computing Hands-On Workshop<br />
This hands-on workshop will introduce you to parallel computing with MATLAB® and Simulink®, so that you can solve computationally and data-intensive problems using multicore processors, GPUs, and computer clusters. By working through common scenarios to parallelize MATLAB algorithms and run multiple Simulink simulations in parallel, you will gain an understanding of parallel computing with MATLAB and Simulink and learn about best practices.

## Highlights

Workshop exercises and examples will vary in difficulty from simple parallel usage concepts to more advanced techniques. 

• Speeding up MATLAB applications with parallel computing<br />
• Running multiple Simulink simulations in parallel<br />
• GPU computing<br />
• Offloading computations and cluster computing<br />
• Working with large data sets<br />

## Instructions

To get started, download **Parallel-Computing-Workshop.zip**, unzip it, and run **startWorkshop.m** in MATLAB.  This will verify that you have the necessary dependencies and add the necessary folders to MATLAB's path.  Afterwards, review **WorkshopInstructions.mlx** for more information to get started.

## Learning Video
Along with these exercises and examples, a video is provided to reinforce how to use parallel computing with MATLAB and Simulink.  This video goes through the **Parallel Computing Workshop.pdf**.
